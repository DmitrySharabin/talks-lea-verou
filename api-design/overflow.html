		There are many ways to have a smooth ease-of-use to power curve.
		If we compare two APIs, A and B, which do you think has better usability?
		Both have a relatively smooth ease-of-use to power curve, so they’re probably not too bad.
		A has a _higher ceiling_, meaning you can do more things.
		B has a lower ceiling, but also a _lower floor_, meaning it’s easier to get started with.
		Furthermore, B’s UI complexity remains lower for pretty much all use cases.
		So which one is better?
		We can’t tell without knowing anything about them.
		How important are the use cases you can’t do with B? How commonly do they come up?

	<h1>Optimize for the right use cases</h1>

	<details class="notes">
		Not all use cases are equally important.

		**Primary use cases** are what drives the design, and should be the most common ones.
		Your API should cater to them with minimal user effort.

		**Secondary use cases** are things that our API makes _possible_ but do not drive its design.
		Making secondary use cases possible is great, because it buys us more time before we can solve them properly:
		users tend to complain a lot more about things that are not possible, than about things that are not easy.

		In fact, if you wait for user complaints to figure out what is not easy, you’d be waiting a long time:
		users tend to blame themselves, and will very rarely complain about the usability of a product or API they use.
		You need to be proactive about this: dogfood! Look at people’s code!

		Lastly, it’s ok to decide that some use cases are simply **out of scope**.
		Catering to them would complicate the problem so much that it would make the API unusable
		for the primary and secondary use cases.

	<details class="notes">
		A smooth use case complexity to UI complexity curve requires a lot more resources than a quick fix.
		But you don’t need to spend all those resources up front and delay shipping.

		It’s common to ship these APIs in layers,
		with each release changing the curve for the better,
		ether making simple things easier, or pushing the boundary of what is possible.

		But where to start?
		That depends on a number of factors.
		What is the biggest pain point that your API is solving?
		Is it that the status quo is too hard or that things are not possible?
		How diverse are the primary use cases? How well do you understand user needs?

	<h1>High level first</h1>
	<object data="images/curve-shipping-hlf.svg" type=""></object>

	<details class="notes">
		If the primary use cases are well-known, and clustered around a few common patterns, and we have a pretty good idea about how to address them,
		we can start with a high level design that covers them well
		and ship extension points and lower level primitives later that explain the high level feature.
		As a rule of thumb, this works well when that high level MVP can cover about 80% of use cases.
	</details>

<article class="slide">
	<h1>Low level first</h1>
	<object data="images/curve-shipping-llf.svg" type=""></object>

	<details class="notes">
		If you have less confidence about what a high level API could look like,
		or the use cases are too diverse,
		or the biggest pain point is around things not being possible,
		you can start with a lower level primitive that makes complex things possible, even if simple things are hard.

		Once we have a good sense of what the most common use cases are, we can add higher level abstractions on top of the lower level primitives.

		In general, it tends to be less risky to ship a low level API first and use that to learn more about people’s use cases,
		which will inform your higher level abstractions.
		Shipping the wrong high level API can be catastrophic, and is much more likely than shipping the wrong low-level one.

		However, there have been cases where teams became complacent after shipping a low-level API and never shipped the higher level abstractions.
		This is easy to happen since users will rarely complain about simple things not being easy — they are far more vocal about things not being possible.
		But their pain is still there. They just tend to blame themselves for it, or resign to it as a part of life.
		There is so much poor UX out there that people are _surprised_ when things work well!

	<details class="notes">
		Overfitting is a borrowed idea from statistical modeling, and more recently very relevant to machine learning.
		Essentially: if you introduce too many variables into a statistical model, it will predict your test data with remarkable accuracy.
		But the minute you try to apply it to another data set, it loses its predictive power.
		The model has over-optimized on a specific set of data and in doing so, lost its general use.

		In UI design, [overfitting](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/overfitting-and-the-problem-with-use-cases-337d9f4bf4d7)
		is when you optimize for a specific use case so much that the UI cannot generalize to other, highly related use cases.

		We need to collect use cases at all stages: before designing the API to drive the design,
		and after to _test_ it and ensure it is not **overfit**.
		Think of it like unit testing, but for UX!

		It tends to happen when we ship high level APIs first but we don’t have a good understanding of the current and future spectrum of primary use cases.
