		Here‚Äôs the most recent API that caused _me_ pain, the SVG DOM.
		Who here has used the SVG DOM?
		Lucky you! It‚Äôs like the HTML DOM, except worse.

		Here‚Äôs the simplest SVG ever: a circle.
		We want to read its radius in JS.

		- It starts all simple, just a good ol‚Äô `document.querySelector()` to get a reference to the circle.
		Easy peasy.‚û°Ô∏è
		But it‚Äôs all downhill from there.‚û°Ô∏è
		- Based on the HTML DOM, we‚Äôd probably try `circle.r` next, right?
		Raise your hand if you expect to get `45` back.
		- _Nope!_ ‚û°Ô∏è You get `SVGAnimatedLength`.
		But, but, but I have no animations here I hear you say.
		Doesn‚Äôt matter! _What if you did?_
		- Anyhow, so we see there‚Äôs a `baseVal` and an `animVal`.
		Since we have no animations, we‚Äôll go for the `baseVal`. ‚û°Ô∏è
		Raise your hand if you expect to get `45` now. ‚û°Ô∏è
		- _Nope!_ You get an `SVGLength`, and it has EVERYTHING.
		Units! Value as a string! Value as a number! Functions to convert between units!
		But, but, but, all I wanted was a number!
		Tough shit, you get everything instead.
		- So then I see `value` in there, let‚Äôs go for that. ‚û°Ô∏è
		Raise your hand if you expect to get 45 now. ‚û°Ô∏è
		Ok yes, we finally do. üòÆ‚Äçüí®

		None of it was _difficult_, but it was _annoying AF_, wasn‚Äôt it?
		So what‚Äôs wrong with this API?

		Being aware of user needs is crucial in designing a good UI.
		It means we can solve actual problems that real people have,
		rather than expending energy solving imaginary problems we think they have.

		There are many different words to describe user needs from different angles:
		pain points, use cases, usage scenarios, user goals.
		For simplicity, we will stick to "use case":
		an example of a common, expected task that people will use our UI for.

		Use cases can be high level, low level, or anywhere in between.

		For example, one high level use case for a screwdriver is assembling an IKEA cabinet,
		and a low level use case screwing in a drywall screw.

		We collect use cases throughout the design process:
		initial use cases help **drive the design**,
		and later use cases help **validate it** and ensure it does not **[overfit](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/overfitting-and-the-problem-with-use-cases-337d9f4bf4d7)**.

		Remember these older faucets that had separate controls for hot and cold water?

		The **use cases** are clear: 1. adjust the flow of water, and 2. adjust the temperature of water.
		The **implementation** involves mixing two streams of water: one for hot and one for cold water.

		The older UI is driven by implementation, rather than user needs, and exposed the internals directly to users,
		resulting in friction and frustration.
		Adjusting either the temperature or the flow required a series of adjustments and corrections.

		Modern faucets are instead designed around the actual user needs, and expose the two concepts separately.
		The internals are still the same ‚Äî the faucet just takes care of doing the translation for you.

		‚û°Ô∏è It‚Äôs usually a good practice to expose orthogonal controls for orthogonal concepts.
		Examples abound of this going wrong, e.g. CSS positioning is another example.

		You may decide to *also* expose higher level knobs that tweak multiple things,
		but the dependencies would be driven by use cases, not implementation convenience.

		‚û°Ô∏è Now what if I told you that A is `element.compareDocumentPosition()` and B is `element.contains()`?

		Remember `compareDocumentPosition()`? That‚Äôs a fun one.

		Then you have to do **bitwise operations** with a static `Node` constant to derive anything meaningful from it.

		But the complex case it was trying to solve is largely imaginary.
		It‚Äôs far, _far_ more common to need to check if an element contains another than to compare source order in arbitrary ways.
		So `contains()` is the clear winner here, even if it can‚Äôt do as much.

	<details class="notes">
		Remember the older DOM methods like `removeChild()` or `replaceChild()`?
		Every operation required a reference to the parent.
		But the parent could be inferred from the node!!

		There was zero reason for this, beyond some vague academic ideas about the proper way to do tree operations,
		and as we‚Äôve just seen, theoretical purity should be at the bottom of priorities.

		**If it can be computed, it‚Äôs your API‚Äôs job.**
		Users should not have to manage multiple sources of truth so they can use your API ‚Äî just fix your API instead.

		Yes, a smooth curve requires more resources than a quick fix.
		But you don‚Äôt need to spend all those resources up front and delay shipping.

		It‚Äôs common to ship these APIs in layers,
		with each release changing the curve for the better.

		Sometimes that‚Äôs the plan from the start, and sometimes it just works out this way,
		as a response to developer feedback.

		But where to start from?
		That depends on the distribution of use cases, and your confidence in your understanding of them.

	<details class="notes">
		If the primary use cases are clustered around a few common patterns we can start with a high level design that covers them well,
		and ship extension points and lower level primitives later that explain the high level feature.

		As a rule of thumb, this works well when that high level MVP can cover at least **80%** of use cases.

	<details class="notes">
		Otherwise, it tends to be safer to start with a lower level primitive that makes complex things possible,
		and later ship shortcuts and other higher leven abstractions on top of it.

		This has the benefit that once you deploy it, you can see how people use it and use that knowledge to design a better high level API.

		The wrong high-level API will not be used at all,
		whereas an API that is too low-level will be painful, but still usable.

		One danger with that path is complacency.
		It‚Äôs common to ship a low-level API planning to later ship a higher level one and never do so.
		This is easy to happen since users will rarely complain about simple things not being easy ‚Äî they are far more vocal about things not being possible.
		But their pain is still there. They just tend to blame themselves for it, or resign to it as a part of life and build their own abstractions.
		There is so much poor UX out there that people are _surprised_ when things work well!

		Here‚Äôs a disaster turned success story.

		For years, all we had was this super high level `toLocaleString()` method on `Date` objects,
		that gave you some formatted datetime in the user‚Äôs locale.
		What was that? Who knows.
		What format did you get? Who knows.

		It was so high level it was practically useless.
		But once the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` API came along, it also enhanced the `toLocaleString()` method,
		so that you could get progressively more control over the output format.

		‚û°Ô∏è You want to just provide a locale? You can do that and it will deal.
		‚û°Ô∏è You want to just provide a hint about how long the date should be? You can do that and it will deal.
		‚û°Ô∏è You want to control the format and presence of each individual part of the date? You can do that too.
		‚û°Ô∏è You want total control, and just want the API to give you a data structure of all the parts?
		You guessed it, you can do that too.

		The curve is as smooth as it gets.

	<details class="notes">
		Most of the high level usability concepts transfer pretty well to API design.
		Take user testing for example.

		Dogfooding is great, but it‚Äôs not enough.
		You know too much about your UI.
		You need to see how people who are not you use what you designed.

		User testing is surrounded by many misconceptions.
		One misconception is that it only applies to visual interfaces.

		The core idea is to get ahold of a few representative users (and for an API these will be developers, but _not_ developers of that API),
		ask them to perform a few representative tasks,
		observe what they do, where they succeed, and where they struggle.
		None of this requires visuals.

		For user testing to be valuable, it‚Äôs important that you **shut up and let the users the talking**.
		Make it clear upfront that you are testing the design, not them, and that you can answer their questions after, but not during.
		You can give them documentation, and even a brief tutorial in the beginning, but after that, you should not help them,
		only encourage them to think out loud and ask non-leading questions.

	<details class="notes">
		Another misconception is that user testing is time-consuming and expensive.
		Nope, you need no special equipment, it can be done over Zoom, or live, by sitting next to someone and observing them.

		You also [only need five users](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/)
		to uncover 80% of the problems.
		Even just two users will reveal half of the issues!

		User testing can also be fantastic in resolving these long bikeshedding debates in a team.
		Should we call it this or that? Should we use positional arguments or an object literal?
		Test with both! In most cases, the answer will become clear pretty fast.

		It‚Äôs common to hear devs say that users are doing it wrong.

		If one user makes a mistake using your UI, it might be their fault.
		But if several users are making the same mistake, the problem lies with your UI and instead of blaming them, you should focus on fixing it.

		Take CSS-in-JS for example.
		So many people think developers using it are _doing it wrong_ and should "simply" learn to use CSS properly.
		But it‚Äôs more productive to figure out _what_ exactly is the need CSS-in-JS is solving,
		and focus on improving CSS so that it‚Äôs less necessary.

	<details class="notes">
		But beyond all design principles,

		Simply **caring** about users goes a long way, and matters more than any individual principle.

		Think about the humans that will use the APIs you‚Äôre designing.
